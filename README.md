[00:19.03] Some don't require affection
[00:23.18] But you pull at my heart every time
[00:28.04] And you know I've been lost in direction
[00:32.61] So then why do I keep it alive
[00:37.53] Said you'd rather just wait 'till the summer
[00:42.34] All to see if you'll leave me to dry
[00:47.18] What you waiting for? (Baby)
[00:49.47] Oh the way you're torn (Maybe)
[00:52.06] You got lots to choose
[00:56.50] What about me?
[00:59.53] 'Cause I've been waiting for free
[01:04.37] You watch me hold to my tongue every night
[01:09.26] The stars don't align
[01:11.55] But I'm okay that it's me
[01:16.74] Texting don't help the complexion
[01:20.75] I would rather you speak all the words
[01:25.15] Tell me why I always change my mood for perfection
[01:30.21] So alone is what I prefer
[01:35.17] Yeah you know
[01:37.47] How I breath
[01:39.71] Still you'd rather fall in love with someone else than me
[01:44.68] What you waiting for? (Baby)
[01:47.25] Oh the way you're torn (Maybe)
[01:49.52] You got lots to choose
[01:53.84] What about me?
[01:56.92] 'Cause I've been waiting for free
[02:01.87] You watch me hold to my tongue every night
[02:06.99] The stars don't align
[02:09.30] But I'm okay that it's me
[02:13.10] What about me?
[02:16.13] 'Cause I've been waiting for free
[02:21.03] You watch me hold to my tongue every night
[02:25.98] The stars don't align
[02:28.25] But I'm okay that it's me
